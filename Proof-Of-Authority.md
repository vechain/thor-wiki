# PoA (Proof-Of-Authority)

## Introduction To VeChainThor designed PoA consensus Protocol

PoA protocol uses a set of “authorities” nodes (VeChainThor name such nodes as masternodes) that are explicitly allowed to produce new blocks and secure the blockchain.

The benefits and advantages of general PoA consensus protocol are described at the beginning section of the above linked article. However, unlike other PoA protocols, VeChainThor designed PoA consensus protocol adopts a novel algorithm, DPRP, Determine Pseudo Random Process, to generate the sequence of order for master nodes to produce the specific block.

## Potential Attack Risk
The potential risk may occur that if the masternodes (block producer) are lined up with a fixed order and if a continuous sequence of masternodes (block producers) are dishonest, the blockchain system may be attacked by such masternodes, thus strategically we reorder the sequence of masternodes with DPRP mechanism when producing a block.
